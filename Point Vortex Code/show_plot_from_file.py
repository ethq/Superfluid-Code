# seed: 851125867 has an energy gain of ~10 using rk4. Energy gain is the same with rk5. circulations all positive
# seed: 919776311 is balanced.
# seed: 179172593 is balanced, and image/real energy differentials are mirrored 
# seed: 768390681 is pure positive, deviation ~ 68    shows extremely odd behaviour of image energies
# seed: 128234509 is pure positive, deviation ~ 1.7

# Whats the difference between these two seeds?
